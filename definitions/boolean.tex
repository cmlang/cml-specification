The \emph{Boolean} type accepts only two literal expressions (\ref{ch:literals})
in CML: \verb|true| or \verb|false|.
When either of these two literals is found in \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions}),
its \emph{type} is inferred to be \emph{Boolean}.

Any \emph{expression} inferred to be of the \emph{Boolean} type
may be used as an operand of \emph{logical expressions} (\ref{ch:logical}).
