Figure \ref{fig:stx:concept} specifies the syntax used
to declare a \emph{concept} (\ref{ch:concepts}),
and in turn its generalizations.
A list of NAMEs may be enumerated after the declared \emph{concept}'s NAME,
referring to other \emph{concepts} that this concept is a specialization of.

Figure \ref{fig:meta:concept} presents the \emph{Concept} metaclass
in an EMOF \cite{mof} class diagram of the CML metamodel,
and figure \ref{fig:ast:concept} specifies
the \emph{concept} transformation
from its concrete syntax to its abstract syntax.
There is a unidirecional association in the \emph{Concept} class
that keeps track of the generalization/specialization relationships,
which is named \emph{generalizations}.
It is an \emph{ordered set} referencing all \emph{concepts}
whose NAMEs were enumerated in the \emph{GeneralizationList}
of the declared \emph{concept}.
