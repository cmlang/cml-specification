CML is a statically-typed language.
All its \emph{properties} (\ref{ch:properties})
and \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions}) must have all their \emph{types} declared or inferred at compilation time.
Additionally:

\begin{itemize}
\item the type of a \emph{property} must be compatible with the type of its \emph{expression};
\item the type of the \emph{operands} must be compatible with its \emph{operator};
\item the type of a \emph{property redefinition} must be compatible with
the original \emph{property definition} in the \emph{generalization};
\item and the type of the arguments in a \emph{invocation} must be compatible with the
type of the declared parameters of the corresponding \emph{function}.
\end{itemize}

In order to verify the types during the model validation,
the model elements that have must have an associated type
are all specializations of the \emph{TypedElement} metaclass,
which has the abstract property \emph{type}.
Each \emph{TypedElement} specialization must redefine the \emph{type} property
in order to be able to infer its type.
