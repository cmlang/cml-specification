\emph{Relational expressions} are composed by the \emph{relational operators},
which only accept as operands the \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
of a \emph{relational type},
which include \emph{String} (\ref{ch:string}),
the \emph{numeric} (\ref{ch:numeric-types})
and \emph{floating-point} (\ref{ch:floating-point}) types,
but exclude \emph{Boolean} (\ref{ch:boolean})
and \emph{reference types} (\ref{ch:concept-types}).
