The \emph{floating-point types} in CML are \emph{Float} and \emph{Double}
for single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit), respectively.
They belong to the group of \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}),
which are shown in tables \ref{tab:core-primitive-types} and \ref{tab:additional-primitive-types}.

Each \emph{floating-point type}
has a specific \emph{literal expression syntax} (\ref{ch:literals}),
which allows them to be inferred uniquely.
\emph{Literal expressions} of the \emph{Float} type may be equivalent
to \emph{literal expressions} within the same range of the \emph{Double} type.
This allows type inference of \emph{arithmetic expressions} (\ref{ch:arithmetic})
and \emph{relational expressions} (\ref{ch:relational}).

In order to prevent data/precision loss,
it is disallowed the coercion of a value of a \emph{numeric type}
(\ref{ch:numeric-types}) to a value of a \emph{floating-point type},
and vice-versa.
That means it is only possible to combine \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
of \emph{floating-point} and \emph{numeric} types
with explicit conversion.
