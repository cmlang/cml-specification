The \emph{operands} are concatenated using the string concatenation operation
provided by the target language.
If the \emph{operand type} is not \emph{String},
then it is evaluated and the resulting value is converted to a \emph{String} value,
which is then concatenated with the other \emph{String} values.
The conversion of the \emph{operands} is dependent on the target programming language,
but it is normally done using the standard methods,
such as \emph{Objects.toString()} in Java, or \emph{str()} in Python.
