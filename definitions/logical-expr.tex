In CML, \emph{logical expressions} are composed by the logical operators,
which only accept as operands the \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
of the \emph{Boolean} type (\ref{ch:boolean}).
An error is reported by the compiler if any of the \emph{operands}
of a \emph{logical expression} is inferred to be of a \emph{type}
other than \emph{Boolean}.

All logical operators are infixed,
except for the negation operator (\verb|not|),
which is prefixed and unary.
The associativity of the binary, logical operators is always from left to right.
