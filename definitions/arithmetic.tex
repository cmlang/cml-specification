In CML, \emph{arithmetic expressions} are composed by
the \emph{arithmetic operators},
which only accept as operands
the \emph{expressions} of \emph{numeric} (\ref{ch:numeric-types})
and \emph{floating-point} (\ref{ch:floating-point}) types.
All \emph{arithmetic operators} are infixed,
but the addition (\verb|+|) and subtraction (\verb|-|) operators may also be prefixed when used in the unary form.
The associativity of the arithmetic operators is from left to right,
except for the exponentiation operator (\verb|^|),
where it is from right to left.
