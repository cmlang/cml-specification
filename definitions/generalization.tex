A \emph{concept} (\ref{ch:concepts}) in CML may be generalized by another \emph{concept}.
In other words, a \emph{concept} may be considered a specialization of another \emph{concept}.
Generalized \emph{concepts} have \emph{properties} (\ref{sec:properties})
that apply to a larger set of instances,
while specialized \emph{concepts} have \emph{properties}
that only apply to a subset of those instances.

In the UML \cite{uml} metamodel,
such generalization/specialization relationship between \emph{classes}
is known as \emph{generalization}, which is the name of the metaclass in the UML metamodel.
The original version of the ER \cite{er} metamodel lacked this kind of relationship
between \emph{entity types}.
