\emph{Expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions}) of
the \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}),
such as the \emph{String} type (\ref{ch:string}),
may be combined with the ampersand (\emph{\&}) operator
for concatenation.
The resulting \emph{expression} is always of \emph{String} type,
regardless of the operand types.

Only \emph{expressions} of \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
may be used as operands of a \emph{string concatenation} expression.
If the operand type is not \emph{String},
then it is evaluated and the resulting value is converted to a \emph{String} value,
which is then concatenated with the other \emph{String} values.

It is possible that none of the operands are of \emph{String} type.
All operands are converted to \emph{String} before concatenation.
The conversion is dependent on the target programming language,
but it is normally done using the standard methods,
such as \emph{Objects.toString()} in Java, or \emph{str()} in Python.

The associativity of the concatenation operator is from left to right,
just like the \emph{arithmetic operators} (\ref{ch:arithmetic}).
