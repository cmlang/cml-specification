From the smallest set to the largest one,
the \emph{numeric types} are the following in CML:
\emph{Byte}, \emph{Short}, \emph{Integer}, \emph{Long} and \emph{Decimal}.
They belong to the group of \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}),
which are shown in tables \ref{tab:core-primitive-types} and \ref{tab:additional-primitive-types}.
