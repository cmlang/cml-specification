\emph{Derived associations} are declared by \emph{derived properties} (\ref{ch:properties}),
which associate a \emph{source-concept} to a \emph{target-concept}
via an \emph{expression} (\ref{ch:expressions}).
In order to obtain a reference to a \emph{target-concept} (\ref{ch:concepts}),
it is necessary to evaluate the \emph{expression} of the \emph{derived property}.
Among the possible \emph{sub-expressions}
that are part of the \emph{expression} of the \emph{derived association},
there are \emph{path expressions} (\ref{ch:paths}) of other \emph{associations},
which server as the base for the \emph{derived association}.
