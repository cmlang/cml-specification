The frontend receives as input the \emph{CML source files}.
It will parse the files and generate an internal representation of the \emph{CML model}.

Syntactical and semantic validations will be performed at this point.
Any syntax and constraint errors are presented to the developer, interrupting the progress to the next phase.
If the \emph{source files} are parsed and validated successfully, then the internal representation (the AST) of the \emph{CML model} is provided as the input for the \emph{backend} component.
