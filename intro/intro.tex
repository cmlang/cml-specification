This document specifies the \emph{Conceptual Modeling Language}, or CML for short.
CML enables the modeling of the information of software systems.
It focuses on modeling the structural aspects of such systems,
having less emphasis on the behavioral aspects.
Using CML,
it is possible to represent the information as understood by the system users,
while disregarding its physical organization as implemented by target languages or technologies.

In this first part of the CML specification,
the first chapter will provide an overview of the CML compiler's architecture,
and the second chapter describes the organization and notation
used in the remainder of this document.
The second part describes that structural constructs of the language
that enable conceptual modeling.
The third part focuses on the semantics of type checking.
The fourth part covers values and expressions.
The fifth part describes code generation.
The last part will cover organization and sharing of conceptual models.
