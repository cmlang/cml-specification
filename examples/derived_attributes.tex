Figure \ref{fig:ex:attributes} presents two examples of \emph{derived attributes}
declared in CML.
As shown,
the attribute \textbf{c} is derived from an \emph{expression}
that refers to other \emph{attributes}.
In order to differentiate \emph{attributes} with initial values,
such as \textbf{b},
from \emph{derived attributes},
such as \textbf{c},
a forward slash (``/'') prefixes the name of the latter.
The attribute \textbf{e} is an example of a \emph{derived attribute}
where the type is inferred from the given \emph{expression},
instead of being specified.
