In CML, \emph{referential expressions} are composed by the referential operators,
which only accept as operands the \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
resulting in references (\ref{ch:concept-types}).
That excludes all \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}).

The \emph{referential equality operator} (\verb|is|)
results in the \verb|true| value
if both operands reference the same instance.
The \emph{referential inequality operator} (\verb|is|)
results in \verb|true| if the refecences do not point to the same instance.
