The table \ref{tab:type-casting} presents the \emph{type-casting operators}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{ L{1cm} L{3cm} L{4.5cm} l }
\hline
Oper. & Operation & Resulting Type & Example \\
\hline
\verb|as| & Safe Type-Casting & Type and cardinality of second operand. \verb|members as Task*| \\
\verb|as!| & Forced Type-Casting & Type and cardinality of second operand. & \verb|members as! Task| \\
\verb|as?| & Condicional Type-Casting & Type of second operand,
only optional (?) or sequential (*) cardinality & \verb|member as? Task?|
\end{tabular}
\caption{Type-Casting Operators}
\label{tab:type-casting}
\end{table}

The \emph{safe type-casting operator} (\verb|as|)
may only be applied when the casting is guaranteed to work
and the resulting expression has the same cardinality
as the original one.
The \emph{forced type-casting operator} (\verb|as!|)
may raise an exception at runtime
if the actual type of the instance is not compatible with the expected type.
The \emph{conditional type-casting operator} (\verb|as?|)
automatically selects the compatible instances,
never raising an expception at runtime.
