The \emph{String} type in CML represents a 16-bit Unicode character sequence,
matching the same type in other programming languages,
as described in table \ref{tab:core-primitive-types}.

There is a specific \emph{literal expression syntax} (\ref{ch:literals})
for \emph{String} values,
which allows them to be inferred uniquely.
\emph{Expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions}) of the \emph{String} type
may be the operands of \emph{relational expressions} (\ref{ch:relational}).
They may also be combined with the ampersand (\emph{\&}) operator
for concatenation (\ref{ch:string-concatenation}),
in which case the resulting \emph{expression} is of \emph{String} type.
