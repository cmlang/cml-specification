\emph{Expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions}) of the \emph{String} type (\ref{ch:string})
may be combined with the ampersand (\emph{\&}) operator
for concatenation (\ref{ch:string-concatenation}).
The resulting \emph{expression} is of \emph{String} type.

Only \emph{expressions} of \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
may be used as operands of a \emph{string concatenation} expression.
In that case,
they are evaluated and the resulting value is converted to a \emph{String} value,
which is then concatenated like any other \emph{String} value.
It is possible that none of the operands are of \emph{String} type.
All operands are converted to \emph{String} before concatenation.

The associativity of the concatenation operator is from left to right,
just like the \emph{arithmetic operators} (\ref{ch:arithmetic}).
