A \emph{concept} in CML represents anything
that has a coherent, cohesive and relevant meaning in a domain.
In the ER \cite{er} metamodel,
it corresponds to an \emph{entity set} (or an \emph{entity type});
in UML \cite{uml},
to a \emph{class}.
The CML \emph{concept} differs, however, from the UML \emph{class},
because it has only \emph{properties} (\ref{ch:properties}),
while the UML \emph{class} may also have \emph{operations}.
