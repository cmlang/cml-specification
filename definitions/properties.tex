A \emph{property} in CML may hold values of primitive types,
in which case they correspond to \emph{attributes}
on the ER \cite{er} and UML \cite{uml} metamodels;
or they may hold references (or collections of references)
linking to instances of other \emph{concepts},
in which case they correspond to a \emph{relationship} on the ER metamodel,
and to \emph{associations} on the UML metamodel.
