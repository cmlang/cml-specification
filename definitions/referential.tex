In CML, \emph{referential expressions} are composed by the referential operators,
which only accept as operands the \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
resulting in references (\ref{ch:references}).
That excludes all \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}).
All referential operators are infixed.
There is no associativity between referential operators.
