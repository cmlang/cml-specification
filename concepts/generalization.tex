\begin{definition}
A \emph{concept} in CML may specialize another one,
which is the same as saying that a \emph{concept} is generalized by another one.
In the UML \cite{uml} metamodel,
this generalization/specialization relationship between \emph{classes}
is known as \emph{generalization}, which is the name of the metaclass in the metamodel.
The original version of the ER \cite{er} metamodel lacked this kind of relationship.
