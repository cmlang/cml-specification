CML supports a kind of \emph{expression} (\ref{ch:expressions})
called \emph{comprehension},
which is a flexible and expressive way
to create new \emph{sequences} (\ref{ch:sequence-types})
or to calculate \emph{values} or \emph{references} from existing ones.

The \emph{comprehension expressions} in CML are similar to the
set builder notation in mathematics,
and also to \emph{list comprehensions} in Python,
or \emph{for comprehensions} in Scala.
Unlike those languages, in CML,
\emph{comprehensions} can be combined using the pipe (\verb!|!) operator
and \emph{functions} (\ref{ch:comprehension-functions}),
making them more extensible.
