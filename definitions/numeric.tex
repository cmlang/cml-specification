From the smallest set to the largest one,
the \emph{numeric types} are the following in CML:
\emph{Byte}, \emph{Short}, \emph{Integer}, \emph{Long} and \emph{Decimal}.
They belong to the group of \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types}),
which are shown in tables \ref{tab:core-primitive-types} and \ref{tab:additional-primitive-types}.

There is a specific \emph{literal expression syntax} (\ref{ch:literals})
for each \emph{numeric type},
which allows the type to be inferred uniquely.
\emph{Literal expressions} of a narrower-range, numeric type may be equivalent
to literal expressions of the wider-range one.
This allows type inference of \emph{arithmetic expressions} (\ref{ch:arithmetic})
and \emph{relational expressions} (\ref{ch:relational}).
