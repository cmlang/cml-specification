An \emph{expression} in CML is used to compute values and collections that initialize \emph{properties} or define \emph{derived properties}.
On the UML \cite{uml} metamodel,
it corresponds to an \emph{Expression};
in OCL \cite{ocl}, to \emph{OclExpressionCS}.
The CML \emph{expressions} are designed to provide the same level of
expressivity provided by OCL \emph{expressions},
but the CML syntax varies from OCL, especially for collection operations.
