Listing \ref{lst:stx:expressions} specifies the syntax of all kinds of \emph{expressions} in CML.
It also lists them in their order of precedence.

Observe that the grammar in listing \ref{lst:stx:expressions} is ambiguous.
ANTLR \cite{antlr} resolves the ambiguity
based on the order in which the \emph{expression} alternatives are listed.
Thus, the order in listing \ref{lst:stx:expressions} defines
the precedence order among all \emph{operators} in CML.

Also, according to ANTLR,
and as required by CML,
all \emph{expressions} in the grammar are left-to-right associative,
except for the \emph{exponentiation expression},
which is right-to-left associative,
as defined by the \textbf{<assoc=right>} clause.
