In CML, \emph{relational expressions} are composed by the relational operators,
which only accept as operands the \emph{expressions} (\ref{ch:expressions})
of a \emph{relational type}.
These types include \emph{String} (\ref{ch:string}),
the \emph{numeric} (\ref{ch:numeric-types})
and \emph{floating-point} (\ref{ch:floating-point}) types,
but exclude \emph{Boolean} (\ref{ch:boolean})
and references (\ref{ch:references}).
All relational operators are infixed.
There is no associativity between relational operators.
