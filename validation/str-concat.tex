Only an \emph{expression} inferred to be of a \emph{primitive type} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
may be used as an operand of a \emph{string concatenation} expression.
It is allowed that none of the operands are of \emph{String} type.
All operands are converted to \emph{String} before concatenation.

The associativity of the concatenation operator is from left to right,
just like the \emph{arithmetic operators} (\ref{ch:arithmetic}).
