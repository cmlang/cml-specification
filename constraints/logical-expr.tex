Table \ref{tab:logical-expr-constraints} shows
the precende order of the \emph{logical operators} in CML.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}
{ l l }
\hline
Operator & Operation \\
\hline
\verb!not! & Negation \\
\verb!and! & Conjunction \\
\verb!or! & Disjunction \\
\verb!xor! & Exclusive Disjunction \\
\verb!implies! & Implication \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Logical Operators in Precedence Order}
\label{tab:logical-expr-constraints}
\end{table}

All logical operators are infixed,
except for the negation operator (\verb|not|),
which is prefixed and unary.
The associativity of the binary operators is always from left to right.

A validation error should reported by the compiler if any of the \emph{operands}
of a \emph{logical expression} is inferred to be of a \emph{type}
other than \emph{Boolean}.
