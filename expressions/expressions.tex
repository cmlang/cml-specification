\begin{definition}
An \emph{expression} may be used in CML to compute values and collections that initialize \emph{properties} or define \emph{derived properties}.
On the UML \cite{uml} metamodel,
it corresponds to an \emph{Expression};
in OCL \cite{ocl}, to \emph{OclExpressionCS}.
The CML \emph{expressions} are designed to provide the same level of
expressitity provided by OCL \emph{expressions},
but the syntax is different, especially for collection operations.
