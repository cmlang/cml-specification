Any type (\ref{ch:types}) with cardinality zero-or-one
is also an \emph{optional type}.
It is declared optional
by the question-mark (\verb|?|) suffix
after the type declaration.

The reverse is not true.
For example,
an \emph{expression} (\ref{ch:expressions})
of an \emph{optional numeric type} (\ref{ch:numeric-types}),
such as \verb|Integer?|,
cannot be used with the \emph{relational operators} (\ref{ch:relational}) as-is.
It must first be cast to \verb|Integer|
before it can used in a \emph{relational expresssion}.
