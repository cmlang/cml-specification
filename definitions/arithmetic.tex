In CML, the \emph{arithmetic operators} only accept as operands
the \emph{expressions} of \emph{numeric} (\ref{ch:numeric-types})
and \emph{floating-point} (\ref{ch:floating-point}) types.
All operators are infixed,
but the addition (\verb|+|) and subtraction (\verb|-|) operators may also be prefixed.
