In CML, \emph{logical expressions} are composed by the logical operators,
which only accept as operands
the \emph{expressions} of the \emph{Boolean} type (\ref{ch:boolean}).
All relational operators are infixed,
except for the negation operator (\verb|not|),
which is prefixed and unary.
The associativity of the binary, logical operators is always from left to right.
