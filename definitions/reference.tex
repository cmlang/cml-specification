In CML, all declared \emph{concepts} (\ref{ch:concepts}) are \emph{reference types}.
That means a \emph{property} (\ref{ch:properties}) or any \emph{variable},
whose type is declared or inferred as a concept A, holds a reference
to an instance of concept A; not the actual instance.
This allows other \emph{properties} or \emph{variables}
to also reference the same instance of A.
