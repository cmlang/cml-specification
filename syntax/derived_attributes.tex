Figure \ref{fig:stx:property} specifies the syntax used
to declare any kind of \emph{property} (\ref{ch:properties}),
including \emph{derived attributes}.
A \emph{derived attribute} must be prefixed with the forward-slash character,
as specified by DERIVED,
in which case the given \emph{expression} provides the value
of the \emph{attribute} every time it is fetched.

The \emph{property} metaclass in the CML metamodel is used to represent
\emph{attributes}.
Figure \ref{fig:meta:property} presents the \emph{property} metaclass
in an EMOF \cite{mof} class diagram,
and figure \ref{fig:ast:property} specifies
the \emph{property} transformation
from its concrete syntax to its abstract syntax.
The \emph{derived} property of the \emph{Property} metaclass
defines whether the \emph{attribute} is derived or not.
