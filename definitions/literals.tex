For each one of the primitive types (\ref{ch:primitive-types}),
there are corresponding \emph{literal expressions}
that represent their values.
In CML, as it is the case with UML \cite{uml}, OCL \cite{ocl} and ER \cite{er},
each \emph{primitive type} may considered a mathematical \emph{set},
and a value allowed by a type corresponds to an \emph{element}
that belongs to this \emph{set}.

CML is able to infer the \emph{primitive type} of a \emph{property} (\ref{ch:properties})
based on the syntax of a \emph{literal expression}.
Each \emph{primitive type} in CML has a unique syntax.
In contrast,
OCL has the same \emph{literal} syntax for all \emph{numeric types},
and thus cannot infer a \emph{primitive type} from a \emph{literal expression}.
