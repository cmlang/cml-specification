Some \emph{functions},
being \emph{declared} (\ref{ch:declared-functions})
or just \emph{templates} (\ref{ch:template-functions}),
may be used in \emph{comprehension expressions} (\ref{ch:comprehension-functions})
if they have a specific \emph{signature}.
They may have one or more \emph{parameters}
as long as the first \emph{parameter} is named \verb|seq|
and it is of a \emph{sequence type} (\ref{ch:sequence-types}).
