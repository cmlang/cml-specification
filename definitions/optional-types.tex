A \emph{numeric type} (\ref{ch:numeric-types}),
a \emph{floating-point type} (\ref{ch:floating-point}),
a \emph{referential type} (\ref{ch:referential-types})
or the \emph{String} (\ref{ch:string})
with cardinality zero-or-one is called an \emph{optional type}.
It is declared by the question-mark (\verb|?|) suffix
after the \emph{type name}.

The \emph{Boolean} type cannot be declared as \emph{optional} in any circumstances.
This restriction allows implicit conversion of empty \emph{paths}
ending with a \emph{Boolean} property to the \emph{false} value.
