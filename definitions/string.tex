The \emph{String} type in CML represents a 16-bit Unicode character sequence,
matching the same type in other programming languages,
as described in table \ref{tab:core-primitive-types}.

There is a specific \emph{literal expression syntax} (\ref{ch:literals})
for \emph{String} values,
which allows them to be inferred uniquely.
\emph{Expressions} \emph{\ref{ch:expressions}} of the \emph{String}
may be the operands of \emph{relational expressions} (\ref{ch:relational}).
They may also be combined with the addition (\emph{+}) operator, for concatenation,
and the mod (\verb|%|) operator, for interpolation (\ref{ch:arithmetic}),
in which case the resulting \emph{expression} is inferred as of \emph{String} type.
