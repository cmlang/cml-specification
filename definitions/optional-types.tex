A \emph{referential type} (\ref{ch:referential-types})
with cardinality zero-or-one is called an \emph{optional type}.
It is declared optional by the question-mark (\verb|?|) suffix
after the \emph{concept}'s name in a type declaration.
\emph{Primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
and the \emph{Function types} (\ref{ch:function-types})
cannot be declared as \emph{optional}.
