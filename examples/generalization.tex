Figure \ref{fig:ex:generalization} presents some examples of
generalization/specialization relationships declared in CML.
As shown,
a \emph{concept} (\ref{ch:concepts}) may specialize zero or more other \emph{concepts}.
The latter are called the generalizations,
while the former is called the specialization.
A generalization, such as \textbf{Shape},
may define \emph{attributes} (\ref{ch:attributes}),
such as \textbf{color} and \textbf{area},
or also the \emph{roles} in \emph{unidirecional associations} (\ref{sec:assoc-unidir}).
Both \emph{attributes} and \emph{roles} are \emph{properties} (\ref{sec:properties}) shared among all its specializations.
Some of these \emph{properties} may be redefined by the some of the specializations,
as it is the case with the \emph{area} property,
which is redefined by \textbf{Rectangle}, \textbf{Rhombus} and \textbf{Square}.
Some specializations may also define new \emph{properties},
such as \textbf{width} and \textbf{height} in \textbf{Rectangle},
which characterize only instances of this specialization.
A \emph{concept} may be a specialization of two or more other \emph{concepts},
as seen with \textbf{Square},
which specializes both \textbf{Rectangle} and \textbf{Rhombus},
and thus can redefine \emph{properties} of both generalizations.
If a \emph{property} has been defined by more than one generalization,
then it must be redefined by the specialization
in order to resolve the definition conflict,
which is the case with \textbf{area} in \textbf{Square}. 
If a redefinition suitable for both generalizations is unattainable,
it may be an indication that either the specialization or the generalizations
are unsound from the domain's prospective.
