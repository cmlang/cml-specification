There are three \emph{type-casting operators} in CML.
The \emph{safe type-casting operator} (\verb|as|)
may only be applied when the casting is guaranteed to work
and the resulting expression has the same cardinality
as the original one.
The \emph{forced type-casting operator} (\verb|as!|)
may raise an exception at runtime
if the actual type of the instance is not compatible with the expected type.
The \emph{conditional type-casting operator} (\verb|as?|)
automatically selects the compatible instances,
never raising an expception at runtime.
