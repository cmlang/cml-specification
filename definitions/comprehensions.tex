CML supports a special kind of \emph{expression} (\ref{ch:expressions})
called \emph{comprehension}.
It is a flexible and expressive way
to calculate \emph{values} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
or to query \emph{references} (\ref{ch:concept-types}).
It is thus a more powerful construct than \emph{path expressions} (\ref{ch:paths}),
but it can also combined with the latter.

The \emph{comprehension expressions} have a similar purpose
to the \emph{set builder notation} in Mathematics,
and also to \emph{list comprehensions} in Python,
or \emph{for comprehensions} in Scala.
Unlike those languages, in CML,
\emph{comprehensions} can be combined using the pipe (\verb!|!) operator
and \emph{functions} (\ref{ch:comprehension-functions}),
making them more extensible.
