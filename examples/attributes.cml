concept Attributes
{
    -- Attribute with a slot for values of a primitive type:
    a: Integer;

    -- An attribute with an initial value:
    b: String = "initial value";

    -- A derived attribute:
    /c: Decimal = 2.0 * a; 

    -- An attribute with type inferred from its initial value:
    d = 3; -- Inferred as Integer based on constant "3"

    -- A derived attribute with type inferred from expression:
    /e = 2.0d * a; -- Inferred as Double based on "2.0d * a"
