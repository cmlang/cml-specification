For each kind of \emph{expression} parsed by the compiler,
an instance of the \emph{Expression} metaclass is created,
and its properties are assigned
according to parsed information:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{kind}:
  a \emph{String} value matching the \emph{Expression} subclass;
  for example, for the \emph{Literal} subclass, \textbf{kind = "literal"}.
  \item \emph{type}:
  a derived attribute that computes the \emph{Type} of the \emph{expression};
  each \emph{Expression} subclass will do its own \emph{Type} computation
  by providing its own definition for this derived attribute.
\end{itemize}
