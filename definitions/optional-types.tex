A \emph{referential type} (\ref{ch:referential-types})
with cardinality zero-or-one is called an \emph{optional type}.
It is declared optional by the question-mark (\verb|?|) suffix
after the \emph{concept}'s name in a type declaration.
Conversely, a \emph{referential type} with cardinality one
is called a \emph{required type}.
A \emph{type declaration} without any suffix declares a \emph{required type}.

In CML, \emph{primitive types} (\ref{ch:primitive-types})
and \emph{function types} (\ref{ch:function-types})
cannot be declared as \emph{optional}.
